While primarily known as a Java IDE, Eclipse can be configured to work well for web development too.

## Optional Eclipse Configuration

These steps are optional depending on your preference.

### GLSL Plugin

If you edit WebGL shader files (.glsl) with Eclipse, install GLShaders for GLSL syntax highlighting.  First exit Eclipse, then download [GLShaders](http://sourceforge.net/projects/glshaders/) and extract into Eclipse's dropins directory.

### Git

Most of us use Git from the command-line, but there is also Eclipse integration:

* Window - Preferences: Team - Git - Configuration
   * Verify Location in User Settings tab is set to .gitconfig in the default repository directory.
   * Verify Location in Systems Settings tab is set to {Installed/Git/Location}/etc/gitconfig.

* Right click on Cesium in the Script Explorer.  Team - Share project.  Select Git, Next.  Check Use or create repository in parent directory of project.  Finish.

## Eclipse Tips

* Use Ctrl-Shift-R to search and open files in the workspace.
